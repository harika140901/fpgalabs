# Lab Exercises for FPGAs

These are a few lab exercises to get started with the Pynq Z1 FPGA board.  They are primarily targeted at the course EE5332 at IIT Madras, but may be generally useful to anyone working with these boards (or any other boards for that matter).  They are not a replacement for the official Pynq tutorials, but are targeted at a very specific use case corresponding to this course, so it is quite likely some things are not as per normal recommendations or even correct.

## Exercises

- Basic Verilog example and using ILA / VIO
- Simple combinational adder with Pynq
- Streaming multiplier with Pynq
- FFT
